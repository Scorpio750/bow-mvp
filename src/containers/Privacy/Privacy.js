    <p>
      We are committed to building a platform that is safe and accessible to our community.
      We know that privacy policies and terms of services are usually wielded as weapons to hurt, and not protect us.
      Ours will be different. The Privacy Policy you’ll find below is only a work in progress.
      Look for an email from us soon announcing our official legal agreements, and we hope to hear feedback from you about how we can make this space the virtual safehouse we hope it can become.
