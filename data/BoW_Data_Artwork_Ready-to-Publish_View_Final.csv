Non black SW -LITERALLY- owe everything we pride ourselves on to black SW. Its so important that we are regularly setting aside a significant percentage of our income to redistribute to black SW and organizations that support particularly trans and street based SW. You can donate to a relief fund for black SW organized by @thegizellemarie in the link in my bio. You can also donate to a mutual aid fund for SW of color via cashapp to $venuscuffs .
