Black sex workers have always been at the frontlines of police violence, discrimination and amplified danger of stigmatized work. Despite this, black sex workers have been incredibly resilient and have created a beautiful and intricate culture surrounding sex work. I’m so grateful for every black sex worker who has ever offered me a piece of advice on my hustle, fixed my hair for me, had my back w a customer, showed me a dance move, etc the list goes on forever. Non black SW -LITERALLY- owe everything we pride ourselves on to black SW. Its so important that we are regularly setting aside a significant percentage of our income to redistribute to black SW and organizations that support particularly trans and street based SW. You can donate to a relief fund for black SW organized by @thegizellemarie in the link in my bio. You can also donate to a mutual aid fund for SW of color via cashapp to $venuscuffs . I’m super excited to see what’s going on with the @pdxstripperstrike as dancers and other strip club staff are organizing to combat racism in the industry. There are so many ways to show up right now so let’s stay plugged in, stay active, drink water, eat a vegetable, and check on your friends. We need to stay focused to manifest a better world thru decriminalization, black liberation, decolonization and tearing down the raging machine known as capitalism ✨
EDIT: forgot to add- @doroshow (founder of G.L.I.T.S) is accepting donations for black trans women via her website.

Seeing people who don’t do sex work exploit our aesthetics, actively harming our communities without listening to our struggle makes me feel like chewed up bubble gum. Seeing people in sex work who have never done FSSW talk down on FSSW providers makes me feel like chewed up bubble gum.
Our community is in CRISIS particularly trans black and indigenous street based sex workers. Street based sex workers are on the frontlines of a battle that effects us all. Either step the fuck up for the most stigmatized sex workers or get the fuck out of our shoes, clubs, websites, and communities *AHEM* @bellathorne 😤😤😤
